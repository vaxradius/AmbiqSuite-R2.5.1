//!
//! @brief Example slave used for demonstrating the use of the IOS FIFO.
//!
//! This slave component runs on one EVB and is used in conjunction with
//! the companion host example, ios_fifo_host, which runs on a second EVB.
//!
//! The ios_fifo example has no print output.
//! The host example does use the ITM SWO to let the user know progress and
//! status of the demonstration.
//!
//! This example implements the slave part of a protocol for data exchange with
//! an Apollo IO Master (IOM).  The host sends one byte commands on SPI/I2C by
//! writing to offset 0x80.
//!
//! The command is issued by the host to Start/Stop Data accumulation, and also
//! to acknowledge read-complete of a block of data.
//!
//! On the IOS side, once it is asked to start accumulating data (using START
//! command), two CTimer based events emulate sensors sending data to IOS.
//! When IOS has some data for host, it implements a state machine,
//! synchronizing with the host.
//!
//! The IOS interrupts the host to indicate data availability. The host then
//! reads the available data (as indicated by FIFOCTR) by READing using IOS FIFO
//! (at address 0x7F).  The IOS keeps accumulating any new data coming in the
//! background.
//!
//! Host sends an acknowledgement to IOS once it has finished reading a block
//! of data initiated by IOS (partitally or complete). IOS interrupts the host
//! again if and when it has more data for the host to read, and the cycle
//! repeats - till host indicates that it is no longer interested in receiving
//! data by sending STOP command.
//!
//! In order to run this example, a host device (e.g. a second EVB) must be set
//! up to run the host example, ios_fifo_host.  The two boards can be connected
//! using fly leads between the two boards as follows.
//!
//! @verbatim
//! Pin connections for the I/O Master board to the I/O Slave board.
